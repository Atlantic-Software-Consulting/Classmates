### Where to do your work
#### Backend
Your routes will be made in `pages/api/`.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

#### Frontend
Each directory and file is a route. The main app component will be in index and work will be done in your feature's directory.
