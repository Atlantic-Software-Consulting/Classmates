// Standardized API calls for front end
// Try to use nextjs fetch() method instead of axios
// Error handling:
//    Take care of NETWORK related errors in this file ie bad requests
//    Response data errors should be handled in usaged area ie code expects an object but recieving an array
// Will need to decide on callback, promises, or async await

const axios = require('axios');
